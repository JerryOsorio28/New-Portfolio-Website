                        An app meant to take safely RV families to their destination,  generating optimized routes with data that takes into consideration the vehicle's height for low clearances, weight, width, length and more. 
                        The project had a deadline of 2 months, my contribution was in the front end team.

                    A simple app that displays elegantly the collection of Amiibos up until today's
                    date! The backend is handled by a public API, the entirety of the project was made by me and it includes images, music, and
                    animations.
